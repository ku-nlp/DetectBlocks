Here's my translation of what he had to say in reply to a note from Joji Morishita:<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="460" myoffsettop="980">
				<blockquote myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="414" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="999" style="font-style: italic;">How do you do. I'm living in New Zealand now, and I feel the threat of the media. At first (about 10 years ago), one strange thing was that in Australia and New Zealand the question that Japanese people were certain to be asked was "what do you think about the whale issue?" In those days I would reply that I honestly hadn't thought about it.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="472" myoffsettop="1068">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1071">But recently I started to have doubts after seeing footage of blood in the sea on the 6 o'clock news, day after day - "Is this really ok to broadcast?". Of course, I believe that we must respect the right for people to know the reality. However, it reinforces the fantasy that cows and pigs are made in supermarkets, and only whales are killed on the TV at dinner time, and the news announcer reports "there are evil people out there".<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="336" myoffsettop="1176">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1179">I was really interested to see the gentle looking young woman from the environmental protection group bemoaning why Japan continues to stick to it's arguments inspite of all the criticism and Japan's relatively moderate foreign policy. Then I found the ICR homepage, and it was very informative. Thanks to the english version of the page, in discussions with my friends here, I was thankfully able to talk about the issue and explain some basic fundamentals, from the different species of whales and that Japanese people do not hate whales, to the importance of marine resources and the future of the environment, particularly regarding the population crisis.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="740" myoffsettop="1320">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1323">As just an ordinary citizen, it's only possible for me to correct the misunderstandings of these people with such biases one or two at a time, but if I'm able to remove some such prejudices and have normal discussions with people here, I'll be happy. I'm both encouraged by your homepage and activities and proud at the same time. Please don't give in to those with opposing opinions.</blockquote>

				<div myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="1711" style="clear: both;">
				</div>Some days back an Australian legal expert, University of Western Sydney Associate Professor Steven Freeland said that the anti-whaling faction at the IWC should compromise:<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="519" myoffsettop="1744">
				<blockquote myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="54" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1763">"The alternative is that the anti-whalers will continue to decline any request for whaling for any reason, and the pro-whalers will take advantage of those loopholes that exist under the whaling convention and go ahead and whale anyway"</blockquote><a myoffsetwidth="145" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="1833" href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/the-law-cant-resolve-the-whaling-debate/2006/06/26/1151174130009.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">Another legal expert</a>, Dr Eric Wilson of Monash Law School, has an article on how he sees the situation in terms of law in <a myoffsetwidth="59" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="107" myoffsettop="1851" href="http://www.theage.com.au/">The Age</a>.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="170" myoffsettop="1866">
				<blockquote myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="196" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1885" style="font-style: italic;">This is why the recent symbolic win of Japan is potentially of great significance; by indicating the purely temporary nature of the moratorium, the (slight) majority of IWC members have reaffirmed their understanding of the convention as a conservationist document, not a preservationist one. If so, then the pro-whalers have the stronger legal position. <p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="108" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="1973">If incontrovertible proof of sustainable numbers of whale species can be provided, then the continuation of the moratorium - at least as it is applied to the numerically "safe" species - is clearly illegal, and the anti-whaling nations are in breach of their fundamental treaty obligations. In this event, the pro-whalers will be in an unambiguously lawful position to either resume commercial hunting unilaterally, or, more likely, to secede from the IWC altogether and establish their own whaling treaty system.</p></blockquote>
				<p myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="180" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2097">Interesting comments. Essentially, the scientific argument that sustainable whaling is possible was already won, more than a decade ago. The Scientific Committee unanimously recommended the Revised Management Procedure, and the IWC itself also adopted it. What more evidence is required?<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="617" myoffsettop="2148">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2151">Dr Wilson states that the whalers could either hunt unilaterally or start a new whaling organization.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="758" myoffsettop="2184">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2187">This reminds us of another, perhaps more likely, possibility.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="482" myoffsettop="2220">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2223">Masayuki Komatsu, in his book "<a myoffsetwidth="273" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="292" myoffsettop="2241" href="http://www.jfa.maff.go.jp/whale/document/whalebk.pdf">The Truth Behind the Whaling Dispute</a>" talks about the chance that one day Japan may sue the IWC:<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="235" myoffsettop="2274">
				</p><blockquote myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="90" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="2293" style="font-style: italic;">"The fact that the IWC has been acting in violation of its own Convention is obvious to anyone with legal knowledge. We have a sufficient number of objective and legal evidence to support our claim."<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="816" myoffsettop="2326">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="2329">"Surely some day Japan may bring the case against the IWC to an international court. I am looking forward to that day."</blockquote>We have seen that the US <a myoffsetwidth="379" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="248" myoffsettop="2399" href="2006/06/iwc-2006-us-looks-set-to-cave.html">looks set to agree to some form of commercial whaling</a>. If the remainder of the anti-whaling nations refuse to follow this responsible and constructive lead, perhaps we can expect to see such a case within the next few years.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="279" myoffsettop="2450">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2453">It is known that the Government of Japan is wanting to see progress made, after 14 years of procrastination and filibustering from the anti-whaling side on the development of an RMS. It is unlikely that the whaling nations will be able to encourage enough of their friends to join the IWC and support them to obtain the 75% majority to overturn the unnecessary moratorium. Perhaps court action is the next most likely means of resolving the issue, after the more likely situation of the less fanatical anti-whaling nations deciding to compromise at the IWC for the benefit of whale conservation.<div myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="4" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="2579" style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">

				<blockquote myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="90" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="3975" style="font-style: italic;">"What the United States wants to do is try to find a way to protect whales but at the same time recognize some harvest," he said, proposing a negotiated quota for hunting of whales no longer endangered in exchange for closing the "scientific whaling" loophole in the commercial ban. If Japan wants to hunt whales in the name of culture or science, those killings would come off its quota, he said.</blockquote>This is in fact very close to Japan's position. Japan doesn't view Article VIII of the ICRW as a "loophole", but in actual practical terms, what Hogarth is suggesting is not that different to what Japan would aim for - limited catches. Regarding limiting Scientific whaling in exchange for this, consider <a myoffsetwidth="165" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="588" myoffsettop="4117" href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/sci_com/SCRepFiles2005/AnnexOsq.pdf">the following statement</a> from the Japanese delegation to the Scientific Committee in 2005:<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="461" myoffsettop="4150">

What this means is that when we read the western media any comments from Japan have gone through a filter, and usually only get about a 1/3rd of the press coverage (if that) of the anti-whaling voices, and only a few selected comments deemed newsworthy.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="351" myoffsettop="5787">

							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="5932"></span></span>On the 18th, at the annual assembley of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), a declaration proposed by Japan and others supporting the resumption of commercial whaling was adopted with a one vote majority. It was the first resolution of toleration and support for whaling to pass since the temporary cessation ("moratorium") of commercial whaling was decided upon in 1982.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="709" myoffsettop="6019">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6022">At the IWC, decisions on substantive matters require agreement from more than three quarters, so this declaration will not directly lead to a resumption in commercial whaling. However, whaling supporters having outnumbered anti-whalers for the first time in a quarter of a century can be seen as a sign that the current is shifting.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="334" myoffsettop="6109">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6112">This declaration, adopted at the IWC meeting being held in the Caribbean island nation of St. Christopher and Nevis that is home to 50,000 people, may mark a watershed in the history of the dysfunctional IWC, or may otherwise be a destabilizing factor that pushes the organization deeper into disarray.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="165" myoffsettop="6199">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6202">In 1982, a large number of anti-whaling nations newly joined the organization, and the temporary cessation in commercial whaling was imposed. Ever since, Japan has tirelessly countered anti-whaling arguments of little scientific foundation, such as those expoused by extreme environmental groups, at the IWC. This matter of the preservation and sustainable use of the marine ecosystem is an issue effecting the future of humanity.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="330" myoffsettop="6307">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6310">As a result, the IWC's Scientific Committee unanimously decided upon a scientific catch limit setting method, the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), which would enable sustainable use without the depletion of resources. If a system to monitor and enforce this, a Revised Management Scheme (RMS), can be agreed upon, the moratorium will no longer be necessary.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="554" myoffsettop="6397">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6400">Scientific research has made it clear that amongst whale species, some such as the Minke, Fin, Sei, and Sperm whales have recovered to the point where there are more than enough. Additionally, it is estimated that marine resources equivalent to the amount of annual human fisheries ends up in whales' stomachs each year. Now, even the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) is ready to tolerate whaling under strict resource management.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="408" myoffsettop="6505">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6508">Nonetheless, with scientific data, systems, and infrastructure all in place for a resumption of commercial whaling, leaders of anti-whaling nations have had the following to say: "No matter how much whale numbers increase, we won't allow a single one to be taken". And at the February RMS conference, "We won't participate in any discussion for a system supporting commercial whaling".<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="785" myoffsettop="6595">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6598">The Government of Japan has indicated that if things continue to go nowhere at the IWC, it is poised to hold a seperate international meeting with other nations of the pro-whaling faction. Anti-whaling nations enraged at the declaration such as England, the USA and New Zealand, will take a tougher line towards any such meetings.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="297" myoffsettop="6685">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="6688">The meetings of the past quarter of a century must not be put to waste. Further efforts to break down cultural intolerance, and restraint to preserve the IWC negotiating table is desirable.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="694" myoffsettop="6739">

We can and do think for ourselves.”</p><p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="72" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="7688"> We applaud both these women, and further, we applaud Best for looking at this aspect of the conference and bringing it to the fore for Caribbean people to understand what they are up against as they try to knit themselves into a unit to challenge the might of some of these so-called world powers in various areas.</p><p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="36" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="7776"> What needs to happen now is that the ordinary people of the region need to understand that they have to start believing in their own people, their own experts and professionals.</p><p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="72" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="7828"> Because while these women were asserting themselves, the police hierarchy of this country were “buddying up” to the foreign press, telling them all about the Greenpeace protest incident; while the local press, including this newspaper was being told to wait for the issue of a press release coming more than 24 hours after the fact.</p><p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="36" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="7916"> We are sure that should Massiah and Charles hear about this they would be livid.

					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="9052">Nevertheless, as one for whom commercial whaling is abhorrent, I resent this misguided attempt to undermine the economy of any country in the Caribbean because its government does not find commercial whaling abhorrent.

Yet I would never countenance threatening the livelihood of people who depend on the revenues those ships generate to express my environmental outrage.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="725" myoffsettop="9157">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="9160">Therefore, I admonish regional environmentalists like Keith Laurie, President of the Barbados Environmental Society, against parroting the fatuous rhetoric of environmentalists who threaten economic doom for the Caribbean countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines) that joined 27 other states in supporting this motion.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="155" myoffsettop="9265">

							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10323">Tonga’s cultural art of whaling was very quickly done away with by statute in the 1950s because of political pressures from abroad on conservation and environmental issues to ban whaling. This is a classical example of small nations succumbing to more powerful countries because of the funding and financial aid that they are receiving from them.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="432" myoffsettop="10410">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10413">Today, Tonga is in a financial crisis and it is imperative that we must take stock of all our available resources to see how we can bail ourselves out of this mess. One of these resources is the whales in our waters.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="154" myoffsettop="10482">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10485">When whaling was permitted in Tonga, there were not even 10 whales killed in Tongatapu for consumption in any given year. In the outer groups of Ha`apai and Vava`u, there were even much less. The whales were hand harpooned and whaling was done by a handful of families who were descendants of whalers who had migrated to Tonga. There was never a year when a total of 15 humpback whales caught in Tonga.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="348" myoffsettop="10590">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10593">There are countries that continue to catch whales even with the ban from the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Japan uses a loophole in the IWC rules to undertake its whaling program, which it says is for scientific research. Japan’s whaling fleet returned to port the month before with a record haul of 863 whales from the Southern Ocean. Even if we repeal the Tongan whaling statute and provide for a quota system of 100 whales a year, it will not come close to the number of whales Japan is killing every month.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="258" myoffsettop="10716">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10719">The Indians of North America are allowed to catch whales under a special provision from the Whaling Commission. This is so because the Indians rely on the whale meat to sustain their livelihood and they have done this as part of their culture for generations. How most appropriate would this provision be for Tonga! Those of us that grew up with whale meat can still remember its taste, and the excitement it brought to the whole island when a black flag is seen flying from the whale boats coming back to port during the whaling season.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="288" myoffsettop="10842">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10845">Whale meat can readily displace the hundreds of thousands tons of mutton flaps that are being dumped in Tonga every year from New Zealand and Australia. When a sheep is butchered, the better parts of the carcass are kept in these countries for consumption, and the flaps are offloaded in Tonga. These imports amount to many millions in a year and it is a big part of the foreign exchange drain. Resuming whaling will ultimately eliminate this or at least cut it down to a minimal.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="684" myoffsettop="10950">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="10953">It is claimed that Tonga now has an expanding whale watching industry that is contributing to the local economy. I do not think this amount to a significant sum. I have never seen a report from Tonga that gives the actual amount of tourist dollars that is generated from visitors that come to Tonga specifically as whale watchers.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="314" myoffsettop="11040">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="11043">A resumed limited industry in Tonga that allows only cultural whaling with hand held harpoons will bring more tourists and photographers than this whale watching nonsense. Tongans overseas will flock to Tonga during the whaling season to taste the meat and take back home some with them. This will be added travel besides the current traffic during Heilala festivals and the Christmas season. It will also attract many more tourists from Japan and other Asian countries. Tonga will also become the world capital for whale bone carvings and jewelry.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="408" myoffsettop="11166">
							<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="11169">The Tongan population is dying away from cardio-vascular diseases and complications due much to the fatty mutton flaps that are being consumed by our people everyday. Deaths in Tonga from these heart diseases have increased by more than 400% in the last couple of decades and it is continuing to rise.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="801" myoffsettop="11238">

Thus while at first glance (and even second glance) it seems that whaling is about culture, it clearly isn't.

Denmark and other nations genuinely voted against it because they believe in transparency. Those that voted for it believe in the sanctity of the democratic vote, and the protection of nations from coercion. In civilised international forums, transparency should not be a problem, but for nations at the IWC who are the subject of threats, their viewpoint is understandably different.</li><li myoffsetwidth="762" myoffsetheight="72" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="14448">Japanese coastal whaling.

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15004">The reason why the St Kitts and Nevis Declaration was able to galvinize support from a majority of nations was because it was a statement that, more than anything, affirmed the Principle of Sustainable Use. Sustainable Use was the focus, and this is something that a majority of IWC members now agree with so strongly that even nations who vote against whaling in various circumstances could join together as one.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="601" myoffsettop="15091">

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15130">It is not possible to generalize. They really are an alphabet soup of various types. Oman supports coastal whaling peoples, whereas Denmark and the USA, both nations with coastal whaling peoples, voted against Japan's proposal because of the well-known commercial element of Japan's traditional whaling.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="606" myoffsettop="15199">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15202">Stepping down to the level of individual people, some oppose whaling simply because they are selfish. Such people are simply unprincipled. There is little that we can say to them, other than to point out their selfishness, and to heap shame upon them. Thankfully, I believe that such stubbornly selfish people are the minority.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="751" myoffsettop="15271">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15274">People such as Ann Novek oppose whaling based on a principle that says animals should not suffer. It will probably never be possible to guarantee an instantaneous death for all whales, so Ann will probably never accept whaling. We can all understand and respect Ann's position, although our priorities are different to hers. This is not to say that we are insenstive to the pain suffered by animals, only to say that we are not as sensitive to this issue as Ann.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="114" myoffsettop="15379">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15382">Other people simply have no faith in the Principle of Sustainable Use. Greenpeace is just such an organization. They state that they do not believe that sustainable commercial whaling is possible. They are essentially a left wing anti-globalization body. The fact that commercial whaling would be regulated means that we are largely insensitive to such arguments.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="275" myoffsettop="15469">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="15472">Some groups believe in animal rights so strongly that they will not stop at any means to uphold this principle. Sea Shepherd for example, openly suggests that small developing nations should be bribed by the anti-whaling camp, resorts to terrorism, and makes incredibly offensive statements regarding people and nations that disagree with them.

Also a very little research into the history of the IWC showed the hypocrisy of allowing "indigenous" whaling, but being outraged when countries like Norway or Japan, which have hunted whales since at least the medieval period, wish to coninue their cultural tradition of using whale meat!<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="813" myoffsettop="16223">

The survey area was defined as the area south of the ice edge that was less than 90% ice concentration. In a region where both the icebreaker and the IDCR/SOWER vessels were surveying, estimated whale densities were 0.0324 n.miles–�2 (CV=37.1%) within the ice field and 0.0230 n.miles-2 (CV=40.9%) in open water (a ratio of 1.41); these are not significantly different.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="351" myoffsettop="25991">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="25994">The Committee welcomed the presentation of these results. It was suggested that in the future, only open areas of water within the pack ice be considered as the survey area rather than assuming that density is constant across 0-90% ice cover. The Committee <span myoffsetwidth="111" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="522" myoffsettop="26048" style="font-weight: bold;">recommends </span>that the authors continue these analyses and established an intersessional group to assist in this work (Annex R17). Pending further data collection and analyses, the Committee <span myoffsetwidth="57" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="468" myoffsettop="26084" style="font-weight: bold;">agrees </span>that the study indicates that there are substantial densities of whales within the pack ice for the area covered, and demonstrates the importance of accounting for whales within the ice field when estimating the absolute abundance of minke whales.</blockquote>This appears like it will explain the observed decrease in abundance between the second and third circumpolar abundance surveys. Biologically, it was not realistic for the population estimated at 761,000 whales to have reduced as much as the surveys indicated. Anti-whaling scientists leaped on the finding, but now it appears clear that the difference is due to deficiencies in the survey methods used.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="542" myoffsettop="26241">

					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30402">Hardbeatnews, BASSETERRE, St. Kitts, Sat. June 17, 2006: After losing a close vote yesterday afternoon at the International Whaling Commission, Caribbean nations are vowing to continue their campaign to get the IWC to use the secret ballot in voting on key matters.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="619" myoffsettop="30471">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30474">As occurred last year in South Korea and in 2004 in Italy, Caribbean states were narrowly defeated by a coalition led by most of the world's rich nations, joined by a handful of developing countries, which opposed the idea of using secret balloting instead of open voting on matters dealing with the sustainable use of the world's marine resources in general and commercial whaling in particular.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="773" myoffsettop="30561">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30564">Of the 63 votes cast at the IWC's 58th annual conference in St. Kitts-Nevis, Caribbean states garnered 30 ballots in support of its cause while its opponents collected 33. Surprisingly, Belize which in previous years backed its Caribbean neighbors, broke rank and threw its backing to New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and several other rich nations which campaigned for open voting.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="741" myoffsettop="30651">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30654">"We are really very disappointed," Lloyd Pascal, Dominica's IWC Commissioner and a former Minister of Agriculture, said afterwards. "But we are going to be back with it again next year when the IWC meets in Alaska. Hopefully by then we would have been able to convinced two or three more countries to support our efforts."<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="264" myoffsettop="30741">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30744">The Caribbean received wide support from the African nations, including Mali, Cameroon, Benin, Mauritania and Gabon, as well as from the Russian Federation, Japan, Norway, Iceland, Nicaragua, Morocco and China, countries which believe that small states must be protected from attempts at victimization.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="196" myoffsettop="30831">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30834">Why is secret balloting considered so important to the Caribbean, especially the Eastern Caribbean? "We have been threatened with economic boycotts because of our votes in the IWC and we are convinced that secret ballot would remove the threat which hangs over our heads," said Pascal. "You know, it's hypocritical for some countries to come before the meeting and oppose the Caribbean's proposal because the IWC itself uses secret ballots to elect a Chairman and Vice Chairman. It also uses secret ballots to decide a simple thing as where the next meeting should be held. As a matter of fact we are convinced that it was because of a secret ballot that St.Kitts-Nevis was able to defeat France in 2004 in Italy for the right to host this year's conference in Basseterre."<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="600" myoffsettop="30993">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="30996">Colin Murdoch, Permanent Secretary in Antigua's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shared Dominica's disappointment. "Antigua &amp; Barbuda is disappointed that the vote on secret ballot went the way it did," he said minutes after the decision became known. "But all of these votes in the IWC are very narrow, won or lost by one or two. There has been some narrowing but not enough to take us over the hurdle."<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="159" myoffsettop="31101">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31104">During the debate, several rich countries ranging from Italy, France, New Zealand, the U.K., Germany and the U.S. to Sweden Australia, strongly criticized the idea of secret balloting, charging that countries were behaving as if they had something to hide. New Zealand was particularly bitter, charging that vote buying and selling had become apparent in the IWC.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="503" myoffsettop="31191">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31194">But the Caribbean received strong backing from Japan, which introduced the resolution calling for secret balloting, complaining that the Caribbean and other small countries had been victimized by international environmental organizations and other international which threatened with economic reprisals if they continued supporting sustainable use of whales as food.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="602" myoffsettop="31281">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31284">In 1994, for instance, a U.S.-based NGO attempted to launch a tourist boycott against Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, St. Kitts-Nevis and Antigua citing their voting patterns in IWC Meetings.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="171" myoffsettop="31353">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31356">Joji Morishita, a top Japanese representative to the IWC, said that talk about openness and democracy was irrelevant in this case because of the continuing threats directed against the small islands.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="760" myoffsettop="31407">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31410">Cedric Liburd, St. Kitts-Nevis, Minister of Agriculture, struck back at Australia, Britain, the U.S. and New Zealand by name accusing them of hypocrisy, contending that while they use secret ballots in meetings of CITES, the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, the developed countries were ignoring the harsh realities faced by small islands and coastal states.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="578" myoffsettop="31497">
					<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="31500">"There is hypocrisy within this body," Liburd told the meeting before the vote. "Internationally, in CITES and other bodies we have the same countries, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, England, all of them are part of CITES and the ballot there is secret. Now at this level (within the IWC) they are speaking about transparency, saying that because some of our votes are up for sale we want secret ballots."<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="206" myoffsettop="31605">

There are thousands of killer whales and like killer sharks can become a physical threat (see article on killer whales inside) to our fishermen and their boats.

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="36989">They are noting that in the discussions on the RMP, certain nations have been completely uncooperative and irresponsible in their actions.

New Zealand is saying that most nations who have co-sponsored Japan's proposal have mostly joined the IWC after the moratorium was adopted, so they think it's strange for those nations to support "normalization". Now he is saying that the recent focus of the IWC on "conservation" was also the focus of the IWC when it was first created.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="302" myoffsettop="37238">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="37241">I'm missing all of his points completely to be honest.

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="37295">Australia now. Ian Campbell reiterates that they would prefer the proposal to be "modernization" rather than "normalization" (Japanese officials called this "nonsense" yesterday). Australia says that it is prepared to work constructively with the other nations. Campbell is looking back over history. He talks about things changing, refering to the 1972 stockholm meeting of leaders, and how they called for a moratorium. (Of course, what he ignores is that many whale stocks are recovering now - this has changed as well, but he conveniently ignores this!) Australia says again that it supports "modernization", but disagrees with Japan that the organization is on the verge of collapse. He says that nations have to be mature about the different views that are strongly held by various nations.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="173" myoffsettop="37454">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="37457">Brazil now. Brazil is criticising the language used in the Japanese proposal as being emotional - words like "normalization". Brazil is saying that many aspects of the ICRW have become anachronic. Brazil is unhappy that despite Japan's paper calling for respect for whaling cultures, complaining that coastal regions where whaling is now not acceptable are not noted.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="298" myoffsettop="37544">

They believe there is a great deal of opposition to RMS proposals allowing the IWC to carry out it's mandate. Some nations have said openly that they will never accept commercial whaling. Even when they talk about adopting some form of RMS, this is paradoxical. This is why normalization is important. The ICRW is a convention for the regulation of whaling, and it is wrong to be of the belief that it's role is only to focus on conservation. "Modernization" must be seen within the scope of the existing convention. Henrik tells the speaker off for using 50% more than his daily speaking allowance!

Dominica notes that "conservation" has been redefined by some nations. Dominica refers to the Caring for the Earth document from 1991 for it's definition of "conservation" (which is the standard meaning). (Note from me - this document actually calls for the moratorium to be maintained - this was before the RMP was completed and adopted, however).<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="376" myoffsettop="38192">Italy welcomes a document that was produced by the Netherlands.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="532" myoffsettop="38210">Antigua &amp; Barbuda associates itself with the nations who supported Japan's proposal. Massiah states that most nations still believe that the ICRW is a good convention, and is not happy with attempts to bastardize the ICRW by anti-whaling nations. Massiah notes that "modernization" is an attempt to move the goalposts by the anti-whalers. "Normalization" on the other hand is about reforming the IWC to meet the goals stated in the ICRW. She continues to be amazed by the unalterable positions of some nations at the IWC. She thinks that such nations have no moral right to remain part of the body. Regarding a statement by Belgium, she rejects cultural imperialism. A strong contribution, and receives applause from other members.

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="38879">A representative from Taiji in Wakayama is now speaking (Mr Nihara). 5 representatives from this whaling town are present. In April a whaling summit was held with people from other communities also present. Taiji is the first town in Japan to have organized whaling, with history stretching back 1600 years. From here, whaling culture spread to other parts of Japan.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="278" myoffsettop="38966">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="38969">... the presentation comes to an end eventually. Joji Morishita notes that the IWC is gradually killing coastal whaling communities in Japan. The names of people in the town represent roles in whaling organizations. Some nations have raised concerns about the stock that these towns wish to utilise. The stock in question is the north pacific minke, and the stock is healthy. The IWC SC has also finished the implementation trials for the stock, the problem is that the IWC has not taken action on the advice. Some nations refuse to support whaling because of the commercial nature of the small type whaling. This is a double standard, as other small type whalers in other nations have commercial aspects. Japan is not blaming subsistence whalers, just pointing out the inconsistency. And what is wrong with commerciality anyway? Whale-watching is commercial. Most human activities are. Futher, some nations claim that an RMS must be implemented before they can support the proposal. But the RMS discussions have broken down now. Another reason for objection is that those nations believe whaling is immoral. In Taiji, the people have great respect for whales. These people have never tried to export their morals to other countries. They just wish for an exemption from the moratorium. In terms of conservation, there would not be negative impact by this whaling - but some nations may have a different understanding of the meaning of conservation.

Henrik Fischer has announced that agenda item #7 is first on the menu for today. This is regarding aboriginal subsistence whaling. Under discussion is an SLA (strike limit algorithim) for aboriginal whaling which has been approved by the Scientific Committee. A priority issue at this meeting is aboriginal whaling off Greenland. Last year the Scientific Committee noted many issues in this area. The mood at the Sub-Committee dealing with these issues were better than last year apparently, as a result of progress made by scientists in addressing some of the issues raised at IWC 57. Britain in particular noted concerns last year, and appreciated the work done.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="419" myoffsettop="41088">

Pretty much status quo with regards to this hunt. Austria is questioning about the Makah tribe's not hunting due to legal reasons. Apparently there has been co-operation between the Russian hunters and Makah hunters, as the Makah hunters have not been able to catch whales in recent years. The Russians have been assisting them with training on hunting. The Russians are now responding to a question from Austria on a high struck and lost ratio in 2005. The reason for this is because the Russian aboriginal hunters are trying to target larger whales, and bad weather during the year.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="729" myoffsettop="41322">

Last year the Scientific Committee said that it had no scientific basis for advising on management. However, this year the SC was in a better position. A new abundance estimate had been made, and some other information regarding sex ratios is also available. The aerial abundance survey conducted this year showed no significant different to that in 1993, although questions about stock structure remains. Ultimately, the SC is still not able to provide authoratitve management advice on this stock. Again, the SC agreed that the IWC should exercise caution when setting catch limits for the Greenland minke whales.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="162" myoffsettop="41466">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="41469">Britain asked a dumb question about whether the sex of five whales which was unknown was because this was unreported information, or because it could not be determined.

Again, the SC notes that it's in better position to provide advice on this stock this year as well. The latest abundance estimate was not too different from that in 1987/88. Some SC members believed 19 animals would be a safe level of catch, but there was not agreement on this point.

He refered to Agenda 21, Chapter 17 in support of his argument. The interesting thing about this is that his argument says that if one document says the IWC has competence, then the IWC has competence. This sets a dangerous precedent. It should be wholly up to the IWC to determine whether or not small cetaceans are in it's competence. If this is not the case, it means it is possible for members of one international agreement to change the meaning of another international agreement, without gaining consent of the signatories to that agreement. That would clearly be an anomalous situation. Another 20 - 30 minutes to go before the resumption.

The procedure is that Dr Nicky Grandy of the IWC secretariat calls out each nations name, asking for them to vote either "yes" or "no". Nicky Grandy then repeats either "yes" or "no", then calls the next nations. In the middle of the voting, after one of the "no" nations had voted, and Nicky Grandy repeated "no", she called Benin, who's delegate was seemingly confused by the mesmerising repetition of "no", "no", "no", and called out "nno... YES! YES!"

Joji Morishita notes that some nations vote for sustainable use in other international forums, but vote against sustainable use of whales at the IWC. Japan feels that there may be pressure on these nations that makes them voted inconsistently in international forums. Other international forums also have secret ballot provisions.

The delegate is stating that his country has carefully considered it's joining of the IWC, noting the cost as one issue preventing this. But given that they are an island nation, they feel that they can not relax under their coconut trees while decisions that may effect them may be being made in international forums.

Japan has responded that it will explain the meaning of "normalization" under that part of the agenda. Japan notes that it can't agree to change the wording to "modernization", if the intended meaning is "total prohibition" [of whaling]. Brazil is speaking now as well. Henrik Fischer is noting that no nations have expressed concerns about the naming of this item prior to today.

This is Sir Geoff Palmer. Gosh, he's balded quite a lot since I last saw him. Blah blah blah. He's going on for ages - Japan has called for a point of order. Henrik Fischer is clearly annoyed already.

Lots of time has been wasted on this. Brazil is complaining again, but now Japan is again with the floor to explain. Japan notes that they are happy to discuss matters of substance, but is not interested in arguing over procedural matters. Morishita is stating that Japan's position is basically the same as previous years, except this year they are only proposing the single item on "actions arising". Japan's position is that the global IWC organization is not the right place to discuss the management of regional small cetacean species. Management is neccessary, but other forums should be used to persue such issues. In the past, Japan has received resolutions telling them what to do in their 200m EEZ with regard to these species. He notes that only Japan was targetted with these resolutions. He notes that Japan's position is that as the IWC can't manage global species, it shouldn't try to manage small cetaceans. Morishita hopes to have an open vote on the issue now. He hopes (with a smile) that nations will not do "automatic voting", but actually think before doing so.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="300" myoffsettop="48671">

Guatemala is not present, and Senegal did not vote (not sure whether they are actually present or not). That alone cuts the 37 votes down to 33. Here, Belize also voted against the motion, which would have been somewhat unexpected. Oman displays quite independant voting habits, and voted against the motion in this particular case. And additionally, Denmark's abstention left the pro-conservation countries with only 30 votes, while the anti-whaling nations' votes were boosted up to 32. Slight voting fluctuations are not unusual.

On the Scientific Committee agenda was the completion of new current estimates for the Southern Hemisphere Minke and Humpback stocks. Regardless of what the numbers are, the fact that the Scientific Committee can produce estimates at all supports the pro-conservation &amp; sustainable use nations, and disturbs anti-whaling nations.

That’s how they got the moratorium through,” the Commissioners said.<p myoffsetwidth="722" myoffsetheight="90" myoffsetleft="102" myoffsettop="65743">However, the islands evicted and replaced the false commissioners with Caribbean people when they discovered they were not acting in the national interests of the islands nor adhering to the principles of sustainable utilization. The Commissioners said that, since then: “We are continually subjected to abuse, racism and other terrible means from these groups because we support the rights of all people to utilize whale resources for food, just like we do in the Caribbean.”</p></blockquote>
				<p myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="594" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="65849">Indeed, allegations of vote buying are very perplexing when we consider that one of the supposedly "bought" Caribbean nations, St. Vincent, actually <a myoffsetwidth="199" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="341" myoffsettop="65867" href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/table_aboriginal.htm">has a humpback catch quota</a> from the IWC. Who'd have thought that Japan, a whaling nation, would have to bribe St. Vincent, another whaling nation, in order to have them vote for whaling?

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="65939">Certainly, still today new nations are being encouraged to join the IWC. The means used to achieve this are not clear, but what is quite evident is that this situation would not have come about had the anti-whaling fanatics not "forced the issue" back in the early 1980's by recruiting landlocked nations, nations with no direct interest in whaling, and appointing phony commissioners in Caribbean nations to achieve a global commercial whaling moratorium that had never been advised as necessary by the IWC Scientific Committee.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="682" myoffsettop="66044">

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="66209">The situation at the IWC is what it is because it is stacked with member nations that not only have no interest in whale resource utilization, but actually oppose whaling activity entirely.

				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="66281">To liken the IWC to a ship; is it any wonder that the IWC can not reach it's target destination given that it has been hijacked by those who wish to not only change it's direction, but skuttle and sink it completely? Fittingly it is then, that this year's meeting is being held in the Caribbean.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="483" myoffsettop="66350">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="66353">At the end of the day, Martin, while the vote buying issue may be of great interest to you the core issue of the whaling controversy is whether nations should be permitted to hunt whales sustainably, or not. Everything beyond this question is a side issue or a detail. I believe that they should be permitted, and I wonder what your position is.</p><div myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="4" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="66459" style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">

Demarche initiatives earlier this year protesting against Japanese and Norwegian whaling activities only managed to garner support from 17 and 12 nations respectively, so there is a definite degree of sympathy with the pro-sustainable use side. The anti-whaling nations will have to be committed to their cause to be sure that they maintain at least 26% of the votes to bloc any moves to amend the IWC Schedule.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="129" myoffsettop="71166">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="71169">Thinking about what sort of resolutions will now likely be passed:<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="519" myoffsettop="71202">1) Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd obstruction / terrorist activity in the Antarctic is going to be sharply criticised. This is almost guaranteed.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="247" myoffsettop="71238">2) Scientific research programmes conducted by Japan and Iceland are going to be commended, and further research programmes encouraged.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="306" myoffsettop="71274">3) I personally would like to see a resolution re-affirming the goals of the ICRW, and requesting that those nations which do not agree with those goals to withdraw their membership. Embarassing anti-whaling nations out of the IWC may be one way to obtain at 75% majority for sustainable use proponents.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="617" myoffsettop="71328">4) Other non-member whaling nations such as Canada, Indonesia and the Philippines may be encouraged to join.<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="0" myoffsetleft="851" myoffsettop="71346">
				<br myoffsetwidth="0" myoffsetheight="18" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="71349">Still, there is time left before IWC 58 commences. Israel may still join for the anti-whaling camp, yet further new developing nation members are also likely to join in the pro-sustainable use bloc.<div myoffsetwidth="802" myoffsetheight="4" myoffsetleft="62" myoffsettop="71403" style="clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">
